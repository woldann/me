<Callout type="info" title="Why Open Source?">
  This website is a project that brings together modern web technologies to help
  everyone create their own personal and modern-looking pages easily. Because I
  believe that knowledge grows as it's shared, I've made this infrastructure
  open-source for everyone to use. Now, you can use this template to create your
  own professional portfolio in seconds.
</Callout>

### Quick Setup Guide

Just follow these steps to get your own site up and running:

<Step number="1" title="Clone the Project">
  Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate into the directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/woldann/me.git
cd me
```

</Step>

<Step number="2" title="Configuration">
  Copy `config.yaml.example` to `config.yaml` and update it with your own information (name, social media, age, etc.).

  <Callout type="warning" title="Security Notice">
    Don't forget to write a strong password in the `Token` section. This allows you to securely publish your blog posts via the API.
  </Callout>
</Step>

<Step number="3" title="Install Dependencies and Run">
  Install the necessary packages using Bun and start the development server.

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

</Step>

### How to Publish a Blog Post?

You don't need to connect to the server or manually deal with files to write on this site. I've automated the process with the **Publishing CLI** I developed:

<Step number="1" title="Create Content">
  Create your post files in the root directory (e.g., `my-first-post.tr.mdx` and
  `my-first-post.en.mdx`).
</Step>

<Step number="2" title="Publish">
  Run this command from the terminal:

```bash
bun run scripts/publish.ts my-first-post
```

</Step>

<Step number="3" title="Live!">
  Your post is instantly cached in RAM and goes live on the site.
</Step>

### Technical Infrastructure

At the heart of the site lies an architecture focused on speed and security.
