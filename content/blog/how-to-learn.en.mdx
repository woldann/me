Right now, you're probably reading this article on one side, and on the other tab, you're frantically typing prompts into an AI window like _"Please fix this code, I don't understand why it's not working, I beg you"_. The green flowing codes from hacker movies have been replaced by copying AI-generated code, watching it explode in your project, and then asking the AI why it made that mistake. Welcome; you have entered the modern software world.

First, let's put a fact on the table: Producing something on computers and making money from it is not easy and fun, contrary to popular belief. On the contrary, it is a highly mechanical, repetitive, and sometimes soul-suckingly boring job. If you've realized this and are asking _"Where am I going wrong?"_, you are probably trying to force the learning process into a civil servant's discipline.

This article is a "survival" guide for those new to software (yes, even if you've been coding for 6 months, you're still new).

<Step number="1" title='Be a "Project Monkey": Don&apos;t Commit, Explore'>

Do you know what the only fun part of learning software is? Constantly producing different things and switching to a new one just when you start getting bored. If you try to focus on a single "perfect" project while you're still at the beginning of the road, that job is no longer a learning process for you, it becomes "overtime". You don't need to stay loyal to a project just yet.

- Write a **bot** for a week.
- Get bored and switch to a simple **website**.
- Get bored there and try something **completely different**.

Getting stuck on a single project is choosing the most boring path from the very beginning. Being "flighty" (like a monkey jumping branches) during the learning phase is not a flaw, it's an engine that keeps you alive.

</Step>

<Step number="2" title='Perfectionism: The Biggest Time Thief'>

The biggest trap beginners fall into is trying to write the "cleanest" code from the very first line. Perfectionism is the most boring thing that kills the learning process. Don't try to run a marathon before you crawl.

Let your code be dirty, let it be "spaghetti", **as long as it works**. Trying to perfect it (refactoring) is actually beating yourself up with rules you don't know yet. Let that button be crooked, let that function be 50 lines long. The important thing is to grasp the logic of the work, not to produce an academic work of art.

</Step>

<Step number="3" title='The "Depth" Trap: JS or Assembly?'>

Choose a language where you can produce things quickly and easily. **JavaScript (JS)** or **Python** is unrivaled in this regard.

<Callout type="warning" title="Be Realistic">
  If you say "I will learn everything from the basics, from the hardware level,
  so I'm starting with C"; then why don't you start with Assembly language? If
  we are going deep, how about entering data manually into the processor's
  registers?
</Callout>

My advice is definitely **JavaScript**. Its range is so wide that you can probably do everything you want in this language. Getting quick results keeps the dopamine level in your brain alive.

</Step>

<Step number="4" title='Stop Making Calculators'>

Don't let anyone tell you "Let's make a calculator". These are the most soulless projects in the world. If you have even a small project idea in mind, you are very lucky, start it immediately.

If you don't have an idea, listen to those who offer you a challenge. Determine your own need: Say _"I need to check the prices on this website everyday"_ and try to automate it. Have a trouble so that you have a purpose while begging the AI for a solution.

</Step>

<Step number="5" title='Stop Watching Videos, Dive into Code'>

I strongly recommend: Stop watching coding videos. Watching someone write code is like watching someone work out and expecting to get muscular. Those 20-hour videos on the internet are too complex or too slow for you.

- **Use AI like a tutor:** Say "How do I build this logic?", take the code and question what it does.
- **Write your own code:** You learn much better by breaking and making the subject someone explained in 1 hour in 10 minutes yourself.
- **Scour forums:** Trying to find a part of the code on forums gives you a real "problem solving" ability.

</Step>

### Closing: Boredom is a "Feature" of This Job

Learning software is not a destination, it is a digital playground that you constantly break and rebuild. If you don't have a project idea in mind, or even a small problem you want to solve, unfortunately, you won't get efficiency from this job. First, you must find a trouble where you say _"I need this"_.

Boredom is in the nature of this job. However, when you turn that boredom into the strange satisfaction of solving a puzzle, you truly start to progress. Don't try to be perfect, just be a "doer". Write dirty code, leave projects unfinished, get curious about a new language every week, but don't leave that keyboard.

Because software is not just learning the rules; it is the art of stretching those rules with your own curiosity. Switch lanes when you get bored, but never silence your curiosity. Now go back to that chat window and ask the AI how you can do that "ridiculous" idea in your mind.

**Break well, build well.**
